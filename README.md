# Fall of Atlantis
A Ruby/Gosu/Chipmunk "remake" of the original Atari 2600 Atlantis.

#Installation and usage
You need Ruby (tested in v2.0) and the gems Gosu and Chipmunk installed. Then run "ruby main.rb" to launch the game. Tested only in Windows 10 64bits.

#Controls
##Classic version
A, S, or D - Shoot
Hold left or right while shooting to shoot from the left or right cannons

##Alternative version
A - Left cannon
S - Central cannon
D - Right cannon

#Gameplay
The central cannon protects Atlantis from attacks. The alien ships need to destroy it to be able to hit the other buildings. Once all the buildings are destroyed, you lose the game.

For every 10.000 points you make, you will be able to have your main cannon plus a random building restored between alien waves.

#Plot
The aliens are attacking Atlantis. You control the last defenses keeping it from being destroyed.

#To-do list
- Refactor all the code;
- Add the Cosmic Ark ending;
- Add a space stage;
- Use custom graphics;
- Add more sounds;
- Add a high scores board;
- Add a proper title screen;
- Add release packages so players don't need Ruby and the libraries instaled?
- Rename the game?

The original Atlantis, by Imagic, was the 9th best selling game in the Atari 2600 history.
